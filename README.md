## [Youtube QoL](https://github.com/pepeloni-away/userscripts/raw/main/youtube-qol.user.js)
This is made up of multiple individual scripts that run on different youtube pages, bundled together because navigating youtube doesn't refresh the tab.

So far it includes:
* redirect shorts to normal watch page
* remove `&t` parameter from URLs- useful if you watch a long video on multiple devices;  Time parameter is still accessible by going back in tab history.
* remove the `&list` parameter from playlist URLs - so you can middle-click on videos to open them alone in a new tab.
* watch later tweaks - adds an invisible-unless-hovered button to the left of the 3 dots on each video. Click it to remove the video from the list.
* disable channel page autoplay
* action button tweaks - reverse the order of action buttons so that "Save" is first, or remove the others completely
